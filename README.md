LendingPlatform:

This console application is built using .NET 9.0.

To run the application in Visual Studio, set the LendingPlatform project as the startup project.

Each file within the solution has a <summary> tag at the top which provides a brief overview of the class, any assumptions I've made, any considerations I'd make if this was to be a production ready application, and anything else I'd implement if I had more time.
